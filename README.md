# Crypto Mining Simulator (Python)

This is a simple Python-based simulator that allows you to experience the basic concepts of cryptocurrency mining without involving any actual hardware. You can set a simulated hash rate and observe its effect on your mining success and profitability within the simulation.

## Features

* **Simulated Hash Rate Selection:** Choose a hash rate value to represent your mining power within the simulation. This value directly influences your chances of finding new blocks.
* **Block Mining Simulation:** The program simulates the process of finding cryptocurrency blocks. The probability of finding a block is proportional to the set hash rate.
* **Simulated Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations:** The price of the simulated cryptocurrency randomly changes over time, affecting the value of the mined coins and your balance.
* **Mining Power Cost:** A simulated hourly cost is deducted from your balance to represent the electricity expenses associated with mining.
* **Balance Tracking:** The simulator keeps track of your in-simulation cryptocurrency balance in fiat currency (e.g., USD).
* **Status Updates:** You can check the current status of the simulator, including your balance, current hash rate, cryptocurrency price, and the total amount of cryptocurrency mined.

## How to Run

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the Python code (provided earlier) as a `.py` file (e.g., `mining_simulator.py`).
2.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  **Navigate to Directory:** Go to the directory where you saved the `mining_simulator.py` file.
4.  **Run the Script:** Execute the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python mining_simulator.py
    ```
5.  **Follow the Menu:** The simulator will present a menu with the following options:
    * **1. Set Hash Rate:** Enter a numerical value for your desired simulated hash rate (in MH/s).
    * **2. Mine (Simulate):** Run the mining simulation for a short period. You'll see messages indicating mining attempts, block discoveries (if any), price updates, and power cost deductions.
    * **3. Check Status:** Display your current balance, hash rate, cryptocurrency price, and total mined cryptocurrency.
    * **4. Exit:** Close the simulator.

## Important Notes

* **No Actual Mining:** This program **does not** perform any real cryptocurrency mining. It is purely a simulation for educational and entertainment purposes.
* **Simulated Values:** All values, including hash rate, cryptocurrency price, block reward, and power cost, are simulated and do not reflect real-world market conditions or hardware performance.
* **Hash Rate Abstraction:** The "hash rate" in this simulator is an abstract value that directly influences the probability of mining a block within the simulation. It does not correspond to the technical specifications of actual mining hardware.
* **Simplified Model:** This is a simplified model of cryptocurrency mining and does not include many of the complexities of real-world mining, such as network difficulty, pool mining, different mining algorithms, or hardware variations.

## Potential Enhancements

* **More Realistic Price Fluctuations:** Implement a more sophisticated model for cryptocurrency price changes based on historical data or market trends.
* **Difficulty Adjustment:** Simulate the increasing difficulty of the cryptocurrency network over time.
* **Different Mining Hardware:** Allow the user to "purchase" different simulated mining hardware with varying hash rates and power consumption.
* **Mining Pool Simulation:** Introduce the concept of joining a mining pool and sharing rewards.
* **Visualizations:** Add graphical elements to display balance, price trends, and mining progress.

Enjoy experimenting with the simulated world of cryptocurrency mining!
