# Crypto Mining Simulator (Python)

This is a simple Python-based simulator that allows you to experience the basic concepts of cryptocurrency mining without involving any actual hardware. You can set a simulated hash rate and observe its effect on your mining success and profitability within the simulation.

## Features

* Simulated Hash Rate Selection: Choose a hash rate value to represent your mining power within the simulation. This value directly influences your chances of finding new blocks.
* Block Mining Simulation: The program simulates the process of finding cryptocurrency blocks. The probability of finding a block is proportional to the set hash rate.
* Simulated Cryptocurrency Price Fluctuations: The price of the simulated cryptocurrency randomly changes over time, affecting the value of the mined coins and your balance.
* Mining Power Cost: A simulated hourly cost is deducted from your balance to represent the electricity expenses associated with mining.
* Balance Tracking: The simulator keeps track of your in-simulation cryptocurrency balance in fiat currency (e.g., USD).
* Status Updates: You can check the current status of the simulator, including your balance, current hash rate, cryptocurrency price, and the total amount of cryptocurrency mined.
* **Enhanced Features (using external libraries):**
    * **Numerical Operations:** Utilizes the `numpy` library for more efficient numerical calculations, potentially for more complex mining probability models or statistical analysis.
    * **Data Visualization:** Employs the `matplotlib` library to generate charts and graphs of your balance over time, cryptocurrency price history, or other relevant metrics.

## How to Run

1. **Save the Code:** Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `mining_simulator.py`). Ensure your code imports the necessary external libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`).
2. **Install Dependencies:** Before running the script, you need to install the required external libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

(Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in the same directory as your script, listing numpy and matplotlib with their desired versions - see the requirements.txt example provided earlier).
3. Navigate to Directory: Go to the directory where you saved the mining_simulator.py and requirements.txt files.
4. Run the Script: Execute the script using the command:
python mining_simulator.py

 * Follow the Menu: The simulator will present a menu with options to set the hash rate, simulate mining, check the status, and potentially view generated plots (depending on how the enhanced features are implemented in the code).
Important Notes
 * No Actual Mining: This program does not perform any real cryptocurrency mining. It is purely a simulation for educational and entertainment purposes.
 * Simulated Values: All values, including hash rate, cryptocurrency price, block reward, and power cost, are simulated and do not reflect real-world market conditions or hardware performance.
 * Hash Rate Abstraction: The "hash rate" in this simulator is an abstract value that directly influences the probability of mining a block within the simulation. It does not correspond to the technical specifications of actual mining hardware.
 * Simplified Model: This is a simplified model of cryptocurrency mining and does not include many of the complexities of real-world mining, such as network difficulty, pool mining, different mining algorithms, or hardware variations.
 * External Libraries: This version of the simulator utilizes external libraries (numpy and matplotlib) for enhanced functionality. Ensure these libraries are installed as described in the "How to Run" section.
Potential Enhancements
 * More Realistic Price Fluctuations: Implement a more sophisticated model for cryptocurrency price changes based on historical data or market trends (potentially using numpy for calculations).
 * Difficulty Adjustment: Simulate the increasing difficulty of the cryptocurrency network over time (potentially using numpy for calculations).
 * Different Mining Hardware: Allow the user to "purchase" different simulated mining hardware with varying hash rates and power consumption.
 * Mining Pool Simulation: Introduce the concept of joining a mining pool and sharing rewards.
 * Advanced Visualizations: Use matplotlib to create more informative and interactive visualizations of mining statistics.
 * Data Analysis: Implement basic data analysis of mining results using numpy to calculate average earnings, profitability, etc.
Enjoy experimenting with the simulated world of cryptocurrency mining! :)
