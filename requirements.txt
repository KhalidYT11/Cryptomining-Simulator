# No external libraries are strictly required for this basic crypto mining simulator.
# It primarily uses Python's built-in modules.

# If you intend to add more advanced features in the future (e.g., for
# more complex simulations or visualizations), you might consider adding
# libraries here. For example:

numpy>=1.26.0      # For numerical computations
matplotlib>=3.8.0   # For plotting graphs
requests>=2.31.0    # For fetching real-time data (if you integrate that)
